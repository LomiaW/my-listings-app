This is a simple Airbnb listings web app built with Next.js. It uses my [listing API](https://github.com/LomiaW/my-listings-api) to fetch the listings. 

The app is deployed on Vercel and can be accessed [here](https://my-listings-7jipdwow0-lomias-projects-4b8a9ece.vercel.app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
